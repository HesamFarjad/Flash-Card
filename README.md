# Flash-Card
React application that I recently developed for creating and interacting with flashcards. This application allows users to engage with a set of predefined questions and answers, providing a dynamic and user-friendly learning experience.

ðŸš€ Interactive Flashcards App in React

Key Features:
* 		Component-Based Architecture:
    * The app follows a modular architecture, leveraging React's component-based paradigm. This not only ensures code reusability but also enhances maintainability.
* 		State Management with useState:
    * The application utilizes React's useState hook for efficient state management. Specifically, it employs state to keep track of the selected flashcard, creating a responsive and interactive user interface.
* 		Engaging User Interaction:
    * Users can click on flashcards to toggle between questions and answers. The visual feedback is achieved through dynamic class changes, providing an intuitive user experience.
* 		Predefined Flashcards:
    * The app comes preloaded with a set of thoughtfully curated flashcards, covering fundamental concepts of React. Users can click on a flashcard to reveal its corresponding answer.
Code Walkthrough:
App.js:
* The entry point of the application sets up the overall structure, rendering the main FlashCards component.
FlashCards Component:
